# Patatocide: The Legend of Spud ðŸ¥”

## Overview
Patatocide began as a class project for my Game Programming course and quickly grew into a passion project that I continue to develop on my own. The game is a 2D boss-rush platformer inspired by classic run-and-gun games, where players take control of **Spud**, a potato hero battling mutated vegetables in a farm-turned-battleground.

## Development Journey
- **Sgt. Splat (Tomato Boss)** â€“ First boss created for the course project  
- **Captain Carrot** â€“ Second boss developed during the class  
- **Don Caliente (Chili Pepper Boss)** â€“ First post-class, independently developed boss  
- **Fourth Boss (in progress)** â€“ Currently being designed and implemented  

What started as a requirement for class has become a long-term creative pursuit, blending my skills in **Unity, C#, and game design** with my passion for developing unique characters, mechanics, and stories. Everything in the gameâ€”art, animations, design, and codeâ€”is created by hand by me, with the only exception being the title screen.

## Features
- Fast-paced **boss-focused gameplay** with multiple themed enemies  
- Unique attack patterns and phase-based boss fights  
- Comedic storyline about a potato saving the farm from corrupted vegetables  
- Ongoing development with new bosses, mechanics, and polish being added  

## Technology
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** PC (released on itch.io)  

## Current Status
Development is active but slow. New content (including the fourth boss) is underway, and the project continues to evolve as I expand mechanics, visuals, and polish.
