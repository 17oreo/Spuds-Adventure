# Patatocide: The Legend of Spud

## Overview
Patatocide began as a class project for my Game Programming course and quickly grew into a passion project that I continue to develop on my own. The game is a 2D boss-rush platformer inspired by classic run-and-gun games, where players take control of **Spud**, a potato hero battling mutated vegetables in a farm-turned-battleground.

## Development Journey
- **Sgt. Splat (Tomato Boss)** – First boss created for the course project  
- **Captain Carrot** – Second boss developed during the class  
- **Don Caliente (Chili Pepper Boss)** – First post-class, independently developed boss  
- **Fourth Boss (in progress)** – Currently being designed and implemented  

What started as a requirement for class has become a long-term creative pursuit, blending my skills in **Unity, C#, and game design** with my passion for developing unique characters, mechanics, and stories. Everything in the game—art, animations, design, and code—is created by hand by me, with the only exception being the title screen.

## Features
- Fast-paced **boss-focused gameplay** with multiple themed enemies  
- Unique attack patterns and phase-based boss fights  
- Comedic storyline about a potato saving the farm from corrupted vegetables  
- Ongoing development with new bosses, mechanics, and polish being added  

## Technology
- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Platform:** PC (planned release on itch.io, future goal: Steam)  

## Current Status
Development is active but slow. New content (including the fourth boss) is underway, and the project continues to evolve as I expand mechanics, visuals, and polish.
